# Airbnb Data Analysis from 2011 to 2019

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze public Airbnb data in New York City, covering the period from 2011 to 2019. The analysis was conducted using Power Query and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that allows for intuitive and fluid exploration of key information.

## Technologies Used

- **Power Query**: For data import, cleaning, and processing
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Import**: The data was imported from a Kaggle CSV file containing public information about Airbnb listings.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Removal of null and blank values
   - Formatting data types as needed
   - Adjusting headers and capitalizing text
   - Creating a new column by multiplying `minimum_nights` by `price` to calculate the minimum expected revenue per booking
3. **Dashboard Structuring**: The dashboard was set up with key information to facilitate smooth and intuitive data analysis.

## Top 3 Insights Gained

- **Revenue**: The only year with a revenue drop (-38%) was 2017
- **Average Price**: The highest average price was in 2013, at $256.21
- **Location**: Manhattan and Brooklyn account for 85% of the registered properties

## Visualizations

The interactive dashboard in Power BI allows users to explore the following aspects:

- Total registered properties
- Average minimum nights
- Average prices
- Total revenue
- Bar charts comparing revenue by neighborhood
- Area charts showing the number of reviews by year, month, and day
- Number of registered properties by neighborhood
- Average price by accommodation type

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Processing**: Handling null values and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Visualization**: Ensuring visualizations are intuitive and provide useful insights.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates skills in data manipulation and visualization, as well as the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard created in Power BI offers a powerful tool for analyzing Airbnb data, useful for both hosts and market analysts.
